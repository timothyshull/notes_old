Content strategist - content planning is one of the most important parts now for planning and design workflows

Responsive design - flexible and fluid designs were around for years

Most important content front and center

Must accept that the appearance will never be exactly the same across devices and browsers

Better to provide customized adjustments depending on the device than to rely on polyfills and fallbacks

Use webfonts to increase possible fonts 

Must stay current on web capable devices

Mobile first is an increasingly popular approach

Structure with standards compliant and clean semantic code to ensure usability on many devices

Workflow - 
- Start with project brief to ensure clear project expectations
- Content survey - find out a good portion of content that will be included
- Content strategy - start with content and develop from there, ensure all of devices are covered and all content is clearly presented with a hierarchy of importance
- Draft initial site plan with wireframes and site maps
- Start sketching both by hand and in code, use styletil.es
- Prototype - working design mock-ups, check with client
- Develop site assets, icons, fonts, images, other visual content
- Determine the necessary code base to adapt to and then begin coding, test constantly
- Usability testing with outside users
- Final reviews
- Publish and test performance

Graphic Design Fundamentals
- Sketchbook and pencil, software, adobe, illustrator, photoshop, indesign page layout
- Art of visual communication
- visual arts
- typography
- page layout

- great design - form, feeling, function
- information, call to action, uniqueness
- keep end user in mind

Principles of Layout
Balance - symmetrical, asymmetrical creates the illusion of equality, radial balance - arranged around centerpoint

- Use grids 
- Use repetition for flow
- Use contrast to create distinction and draw attention
- Use white space effectively to effectively create minimal designs
- KISS

- 4P formula for improving at design - practice, participate, pick apart, play around with design

Type 
- Gives context to the words and the symbols related
- ligature and serif
- font is not equivalent to typeface, typeface is a family and fonts are the family members
- serif has added parts, sans serif are blockier, monospace is each letter takes up close to the same amount of space

Good types 
- Helvetica
- Arial
- DIN
- Georgia
- Futura
- League Gothic
- Gotham
- Cabin
- Myriad Pro
- Corbel

Typography 
- baseline - line against which fonts sit
- x-height - top of lower case letters
- cap height - top of upper case letters and certain 
- ascender & descender parts of letters that go above and below x-height and baseline,
- tail - part below baseline
- stem - main portion
- arm - arm on capital t
- beak - part that hangs down on capital t
- counter - circle inside letters

- pica - unit of measure that measures lines of text 1 pica = 12 pts
- point - general unit of measure 72 points = 1 inch
- leading - line spacing
- tracking - space between characters across an entire line
- kerning - space between two individual characters
- glyph - a representation for each type of character in a single font

Rules of Typography
- use classic typeface at first
  - Helvetica, gill sans, garamond, league gothic, gothic, futura, times, myriad pro, bodoni, courier
  
- limit typefaces - max 3, use contrast with 2

- Avoid all caps - like yelling at reader

- legibility is key

- don't mix sizes or weights in same line

- pay attention to kerning

- use typefaces that create a consistent mood

- generally stick to flush left and ragged right, be aware of effects of alignment

- create contrast, choose colors with clear distinctions for text

- maintain integrity for typeface

- avoid widows and orphans (line and word wrap)

- use even spacing across the board

- italicize text over underlining for text emphasis

- Use real quotes and real dashes

- dont use comic sans, papyrus, curlz, playbill, and chalkduster

Pairing Typefaces
- Heading, sub-heading and body context, choose mood and need for each
- Opposites attract, capitalization, bold, weight
- Mix serifs and sans serifs
